# language-titanium package

This package contains grammar definitions that extend Lua.

This package is for use with [Titanium](https://github.com/hbomb79/Titanium) which is a GUI framework for Lua (ComputerCraft).

Keywords such as class, extends, mixin and alias will be highlighted using 'support' class and the word following these will be highlighted using 'string'. This allows the class declaration to become highlighted using your favorite theme rather than it being classifed as incorrect.
